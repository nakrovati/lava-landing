Lava Landing is a fast and lightweight landing page application, built with astro.js, TypeScript, and SCSS.

It is designed to be a much smaller and faster version of the original landing page, weighing in at five times less. Lava Landing has no dependencies, except for the lightweight keen-slider library.
